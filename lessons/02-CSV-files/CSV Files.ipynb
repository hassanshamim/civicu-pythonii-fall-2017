If we were to store the lat/long for each airport in every row in the routes.csv we would be writing down a ton of repetitive information and would make the file much larger than it needs to be.

    "- Rework the way data is stored in the above examples by storing airport `lat` and `long` together, rather than in separate dictionaries.  You may have to change the function header of the `distance` function.  **Optional**: see if [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) would be useful.\n",

    "- `head <file_name>` - This will show you the first 10 lines of a file in the terminal\n",
    "  - with both commands above you can pass additional flags to them that cause different outputs. One useful flag is the `-f` flag. This flag will let you follow what is happening to the file so if you have a long running write you can visually check that the file is getting written to. [Link to other flags](https://www.linux.com/blog/14-tail-and-head-commands-linuxunix)\n",
