# Numpy



In today's lesson, rather than a typical lecture we'll be using the excellent [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) which is available for free online.



## Objectives

- Become comfortable cloning a project and getting the environment set up (if you haven't already)
- Introduce Jupyter Notebooks
- Introduce Numpy



## Setup

Today's lesson setup will mirror the process you will use when working or joining a new project.  That is

- cloning the selected repository `git clone`
- creating your virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
- activating your environment (varies by operating system)
- installing the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`



In addition to doing the above in class, we will have a short demo of jupyter notebooks (see [Chapter 1](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.00-ipython-beyond-normal-python.html)).  The rest of class time will be spent working through [Chapter 2](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html).



**Note:** Given that internet in the classroom can be spotty, I have provided a *slimmed down version* of the original repository.  You may also use an online service (link below) to simulate the above steps and interact with the notebooks in your browser, rather than running the code locally.

### Repo Links

[Original Repository](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

- contains **everything**
- very large

[Slimmed down repo](https://github.com/hassanshamim/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

- Only contains chapters 1 and 2
- Reduced `requirements.txt` to just the packages we'll **need** today
- Replaced `pandas` references with short python snippets.  (it was only used to read csvs)

[Online Notebook:](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/master?filepath=notebooks%2F02.00-Introduction-to-NumPy.ipynb)

- Contains all chapters and packages
- Must be reloaded every time
- won't save your work in between sessions
- (may) be a bit slower
